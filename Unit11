Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. Node.js enables 
JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, and runs scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is 
sent to the user's web browser.Node.js has become one of the foundational elements of the "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, allowing web 
application development to unify around a single programming language, rather than rely on a different language for writing server side 
scripts.
